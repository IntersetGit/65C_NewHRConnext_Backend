  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `Company` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The primary key for the `Profile` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The primary key for the `User` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `companyId` column on the `User` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[id]` on the table `Company` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[id]` on the table `Profile` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[id]` on the table `User` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - Changed the type of `id` on the `Company` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `id` on the `Profile` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `userId` on the `Profile` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `id` on the `User` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
